# SLAPI Contribution Guide

The LLNL Data Storage Group welcomes contribution to the SLAPI project.  We do
not have a ton of bandwidth for pull requests, but will make a best effort to
merge useful features and fixes in.  We do not have a formal style guide as of
yet, but expect any contibutions to match the style used for the rest of the
project.  As the project matures we may adopt a more formal style.
